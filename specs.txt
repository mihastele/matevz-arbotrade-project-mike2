Build a full‑stack ecommerce platform with a **Vue.js** frontend and **NestJS** backend, optimized for a sleek desktop and mobile experience with consistent, high‑quality UI/UX on all screens.

## High-level goals

- Modern SPA/SSR storefront in Vue (or Nuxt) with responsive, minimal, and sleek design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- NestJS API as a clean, modular backend handling auth, catalog, cart, orders, and payments.
- Great UI/UX: fast loading, intuitive navigation, clear checkout flow, and consistent design system (typography, spacing, and components) across all screens.

## Note on Product features:
check sample.csv for example which columns the products should have, metadata columns should be skipped, but products can contain multiple images, videos, pdfs or preview links.


## Backend (NestJS)

- Tech: NestJS + TypeScript, PostgreSQL (or MySQL) via TypeORM/Prisma, JWT auth.
- Modules:  
  - Auth (JWT, roles: admin, customer).  
  - Users (profiles, addresses).  
  - Products (CRUD, categories, variants, images, stock).  
  - Cart (per‑user cart, guest cart via token).
  - Orders (create, pay, status updates, history).  
  - Payments (Stripe or similar gateway integration).
- APIs: REST (or GraphQL) endpoints for storefront and admin; input validation, guards, and rate limiting.

## Frontend (Vue.js)

- Tech: Vue 3 (or Nuxt 3), Vue Router, Pinia/Vuex for state, Axios/fetch for API calls.
- Storefront pages:  
  - Home (hero, featured products).  
  - Category listing (filters, sort, pagination).  
  - Product detail (gallery, price, variants, reviews).  
  - Cart and checkout (address, shipping, payment, confirmation).
- Account pages:  
  - Login/register, profile, address book.  
  - Order history and order details.  
- Admin SPA (can be separate Vue app): product CRUD, stock, orders list, order status updates.

## UI/UX and design requirements

- Layout: responsive grid and flex layouts, mobile‑first; sticky header/cart summary on critical flows.
- Visual style: clean, minimal color palette, generous whitespace, consistent shadows and border radius for a sleek feel.  
- Components: reusable design system for buttons, inputs, cards, modals, toasts, tables, and form layouts.
- Performance: image optimization (WebP/AVIF), lazy loading, code splitting, skeleton loaders, and smooth transitions.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, proper contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.

## Infrastructure

- Single VPS or containerized setup: NestJS API + DB + built Vue app behind nginx/Caddy reverse proxy.
- Environments: dev, staging, production with .env config and simple CI/CD for automated deployments.
